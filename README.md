> Build a Progressive Web App (PWA) that feels like an iOS &amp; Android App, using Device Camera, Push Notifications and more. It is based on the course [Progressive Web Apps (PWA) - The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/progressive-web-app-pwa-the-complete-guide/)

## How to Use

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed on your machine. Simply download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) and go through the installation steps.

Once Node.js is installed, open your command prompt or terminal and **navigate into this project folder**. There, run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.

Finally, run `npm start` to start the development server and visit [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see the running application.

## Learnings

- Build web apps that look and feel like native mobile apps for iOS and Android
- Use service workers to build web apps that work without internet connection (offline-first)
- Leverage device features like the camera and geolocation in your web apps
- Use web push notifications to increase user engagement with your web apps

## Course Description

**Progressive Web Apps** (PWAs) are the next big thing in web development as they bring mobile-app-like experiences to your users without requiring them to install an app from the app store/ play store.

You still create a web application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) but this course will teach you how to add features such as camera access, service workers for offline support, push notifications and more. This combines the best of both worlds: You deliver fast, engaging and reliable experiences whilst still having the reach and accessibility of a web page.

"Progressive Web App" simply is a term summarizing all the features allowing you to deliver mobile-like experiences. The topic is highly trending and it also is a topic which is here to stay! Not only is it strongly promoted by Google (actually a lot of talks at Google I/O 2017, Google's developer conference, were devoted to PWAs), it's also quickly being adopted by big companies like Twitter or the Washington Post.

Having the skills to build and optimize these kind of web apps is already an important and highly demanded skill for modern web developers, a trend which is only going to accelerate! Therefore, learning how to build PWAs will give you a competitive edge!

In detail, this course will cover everything you need to build amazing PWAs - leading to a score of 100 (out of 100) in Google's PWA auditing tool "Lighthouse":

- A refresher on Promises and the Fetch API as both concepts are heavily used in PWAs
- How to improve user engagement by adding push notifications
- A way to synchronize data in the background, even if connection is lost
- How to access native device features like the camera or geolocation
